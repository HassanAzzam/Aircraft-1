# Aircraft

Aircraft System
Essential Requirements
- Project’s implementation should be done using Modern OpenGL pipeline taught in the labs.
 Your project should have the following features:
1) [ ] A well designed code is essential.
2) [x] ~~A textured skybox for the project’s environment. (Choose appropriate texture for the sky and the runway).~~
3) [ ] Use and manipulate a camera to move on the runway and fly as discussed in the 6th lab “First Person Camera” lab.
4) [ ] Scene lighting: a light source is required in the aircraft itself.
5) [x] ~~Load basic models (a cube for the aircraft body and 2 cones for the wings) with appropriate material.~~
6) [ ] Apply a third person camera.
7) [ ] You must handle the keyboard keys in order to move the aircraft on the runway and make it takeoff and fly for a certain period and then return back to the runway smoothly.
- Bonuses
1) [ ] Load other models for the airport building and other aircrafts in the runway and avoid collision between the main aircraft and these objects.
2) [ ] Create at least one animation that starts and ends during flying (ex: make the aircraft swing).
3) [ ] Multiple light sources in the runway.
4) [ ] Insert sounds for aircraft movements.
5) [ ] Build a more complex environment.
